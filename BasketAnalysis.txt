Market Basket analysis ai  affinity analysis
under narrow ai 

--> data in the market feild that deals with finding and assostion (a links/pattrens btwn 2 components )

matrix os assosition analysis: (rules)
1- itemset: is the combination of transaction on time becaouse am couting the proba of item based on the whole item set 

2- support count: is counting single item or combination of 2,3 togather  among multiple transactions  frequency
while support is the probabitly  of its presence 
support= nb of an item purchased/ nb of all transactions

3- confidence:  is conditinaly probabitly how likly y is bought when x is bought ? 
confidence(x->y)=support(x,y)/support(x)

4- lift: how likly y is bought when x is bought but taking consideration popularity of y 
lift(x->y)=support(x,y)/support(x)*support(y)

Threshold: value that should be claimed
if support/confidence >= Threshold other wise i dont care about it becaouse no realtion of items being set togather

apriori algorithm  
1- if item set ( basket ) is frequent then all its items are frequent 
2- proba(support ) of an items never exceeds the support of its subset
y3ni support of milk w bread togther  ma ha tkoun akbr mn support of milk eza l milk wate 

STEP 1: note threashold is logicaly set 
support count table c1  and remove the count lower than the support threashold to get L1 table that filtered items and has only popular items 
3/6/over 2/6 - 3/2 so we can directly use the support count


STEP 2:
Now we c2 tables do combinations each item with ALL items ( A B C)= AB Ac BC support count
then we remove the items that is the minimum threshhold  to get L2

STEP3:
Now with L2 table we do 3 accourences toogather comabniations   c3 
and also removing the ones with < the min threashold to get L3  table with the 3 items combinations filtered

Now we calculate the assoscition rules
confideince and lift for L2 and L3 one->2 combination  ex: ABC a->bc  b->ac  c->ab

we set a min threshold  confidence level and choose the best that are above threshthold
