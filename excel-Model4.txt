Excel is A  spread sheet of rows and columns used do calculations, simple data entry to complex financial modeling.

DA steps in excel:
Business Question
Getting the data
Exploring the data

excel shortcut ctrl G (define cell or range A1:A22 or A1:B22 will select both columns from 1 to 22)


excel commands for data manipulation
     compare:=EXACT(text1, text2) (t,f result)
     format remove spaces =TRIM(text)
     sorting: =SORT(range, [sort_index], [sort_order])
          sort_index: column number we are  sorting based one 
          ● sort_order:
          ○ Ascending: True in google sheet (1) in exel 
          ○ Descending: False (-1)
     filter: =FILTER(range,criteria)     
          
Data Types in Excel
     ● Text: strings, numbers or dates
     ● Number: numeric values
     ● Date: dates and times
     ● Boolean: TRUE/FALSE

     each type has a defult alignment:
          ● Text: left aligned
          ● Logical: center aligned
          ● Numeric or datetime: right
          aligned

     Changing data type to perform analysis:
          from number to text: =text(value,"formaT 0000000")
          from text to number:=value(cell)
          Rounding: =Round(cell,0 is the number of decimal)

Data Cleaning and Transformation:
     correcting, removing errors and refining 

     type text: 
          =CONCATENATE(value1," " to have space between the 2 wards  ,[value2]) -> To group 2 cells fname,lname 
          =LOWER(cell) → Transforms all characters to lowercase
          =UPPER(cell) → Transforms all characters to uppercase
          =PROPER(cell) → Capitalizes each word
          =LEN(cell) -> To get the number of characters of a text cell
          =LEFT(cell,number_of_characters) or =RIGHT(text,number_of_characters)-> To extract characters from a text defult number is 1 
          =SUBSTITUTE(cell, old_text in cell, new_text, [instance_num place of word am changing]) -> Replacing Text

     Dates Type:
          =cell1-cell2 -> time difference
          =NOW() -> gives the  current full date and time
          -7 , +7 ,+90  weeks/month before(-) or next ( + ) sametime
          =EDate(Now(),nb of month)->time remove and give 3 month from Now
          =EDMonth(Now(-1))+1 -> first day of current month 
          =TODAY() just gives the date with no time 
          =YEAR(date) -> extract the year 
          =MONTH(date)-> extract the month nb (oct->10)
          =WEEKDAY(date,[return_type (1 start sunday as first day of week  or 2 stars monday as first day of week  )])-> extract the day name 

Data Analyzing in excel:
     =COUNT() -> count number of cells that have numric values only 
     =COUNTA()-> count number of cells non blank within a specific range, regardless of their type.
     =COUNTBLANK()->count number of cells blank value within a specific range.
     =COUNTIF()-> count number of cells within a specific range, based on a condition.

     performing Calculations:
          =SUM() -> sums the numerical values within a specific
          range
          =MIN() ->  To find min in numric range
          =MAX() ->To find max in numric range
          =AVERAGE()->To find avarege in numric range
          =MEDIAN() ->to get  median of a specified data range even nbs we take 2 inn middle get their average 

     Data Lookup: means finding data related to a specific information 
          =INDEX(Range A1:A10, row_num, [column_num]) -> get info of a spesic place row retrive its intersect with column 
          =MATCH(lookup_value, range A1:A10, [match_type 0 for exact match, 1 for approximate match in asd order,-1 for approximate match in asd order1  ]) -> to see if a text  found in  arange The MATCH function returns the position index of the lookup value within the lookup array
          -->to get most out of the 2 fns we combine them 
          index(A1:A10,Match(value,G1:G12,0))
          match will get the index of value form the range G and index will return the value in range A on indexnb from match fn
          ex: match returned row 5 the final result is name in column A row 5

          -->alternativly we have Vlookup fn that is the most important one:

          =VLOOKUP (lookup_value Text,table_array A1:C:12 , col_num of columnn i want to retrive my value , False return an exact match / true return an approximate)

     Logical Functions:
          =if(A>B,return value of true,return value if false)
          =AND(A>B, A>B)-> if all conditions are true it returns true else it return false
          =OR(A>B, A>B)-> if at least one conditions are true it returns true else it return false
          Note we can write nested ifs and use fns inside each other 
          if(avg(1)>avg(sum(A1:B2)),2,3)
     
     Aggregation Functions used to represent data based on a condition:
          =unique() -> gets data that is distinct and not repeated 
          =sort(unique()) -> combined 2 fn togther 
          =COUNTIF(A1:A2, <100 ) 
          =SUMIF(A1:A12, condition on range A, D1:D12 ) ->sum d range if condition apply to range a
          =AVERAGEIF(A1:A12, condition on range A, D1:D12) -> return avrg of range D if condition applys to range A 

     Visualizing Data   
          Data is Better understand when its visulised and Excel has several charts that help us do this
          
          How to do it:
          1. Represent your data properly by selecting the range we want 
          2. Go to the Insert Tab
          3. Pick a Chart

          Charts:
          Bar Charts: Useful to represent grouped/categories data
          Pie Charts: Useful to represent data as percentages
          Line Charts: Useful to represent trends and time dependent data 

Advanced Excel Concepts:
     Modify & Format Charts colors and styles
     Conditional formatting heghlight cells based on a condition

Data Pivoting:
     Applying fn like sum,Count,MIN,MAX,STDEV and AVERAGE to efficiently deliver solutions to such analytical queries.

ToolPack:
    -> its an excel add on to do analysis.
    -> The ToolPak offers a range of statistical
     functions that includes descriptive
     statistics, which are crucial for
     summarizing data sets.
     ->Additionally, it provides tools for
     hypothesis testing, including t-tests,
     F-tests and ANOVA tests.
     -> It includes tools for data transformation, such as random number generation and sampling.
     -> These are helpful for simulations or when dealing with large datasets where full data analysis is impractical.

Connecting Data With Power Query:
     Power Query allows you to import or connect to external
     data, and then apply transformation to that data in ways
     that meet your needs.
     Then, you can load your query into Excel, and periodically,
     you can refresh the data to make it up to date.
     
     The Four Phases of Power Query
     1. Make connections to data in the cloud, on a service, or locally
     2. Shape data to meet your needs, while the original source remains unchanged
     (You can save the “Applied Steps” to be done automatically on new data)
     3. Integrate data from multiple sources to get a unique view into the data
     4. Complete your query and load it into a worksheet or Data Model and
     periodically refresh it.

Data Modelling With PowerPivot     
PowerPivot can process and analyze large volumes of data far
beyond the row and column limits of a standard Excel
spreadsheet.
Advanced data modeling can be done using PowerPivot. It
allows creating relationships between different data tables,
which is essential for building comprehensive models.
