dplyr is a powerful package in R that provides a consistent set of verbs for efficient data manipulation. These verbs allow you to solve common data challenges with ease. Let's explore some of the key dplyr functions:
- Data Frame Verbs:
    - These functions primarily operate on rows of data frames:
        - arrange(): Order rows based on column values.
        - distinct(): Keep distinct or unique rows.
        - filter(): Keep rows that match a condition.
        - slice(): Subset rows using their positions.
    - For columns:
        - mutate(): Create, modify, or delete columns.
        - pull(): Extract a single column.
        - rename(): Rename columns.
        - select(): Keep or drop columns by name or type.
- Grouping Verbs:
    - These functions work with groups of rows:
        - count(): Count observations in each group.
        - group_by(): Group by one or more variables.
        - summarise(): Summarize each group down to one row.
- Join Verbs:
    - These functions combine data frames:
        - inner_join(), left_join(), right_join(), full_join(): Perform different types of joins.
        - nest_join(), semi_join(), anti_join(): Filtering joins.
        - cross_join(): Cross join (cartesian product).
- Vector Functions:
    - These work on individual vectors (not data frames):
        - between(): Detect where values fall in a specified range.
        - case_when(): Generalized vectorized if-else.
        - coalesce(): Find the first non-missing element.
        - lag(), lead(): Compute lagged or leading values.
- Other Useful Functions:
    - n_distinct(): Count unique combinations.
    - recode(): Recode values.
    - row_number(): Generate row numbers.
    - min_rank(), dense_rank(): Integer ranking functions.
